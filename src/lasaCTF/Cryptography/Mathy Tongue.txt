Problem File:
You walk into a math classroom and find the following equations on the chalkboard:

nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
pekalol + mekalal = sakalal
namekalal + fanamekalol = mekalal
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
namekalal * dokalol = fanamekalol * pekalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal
pekalol + pekalol + mekalal - lokalal = rekalol
sakalkalal * pekalol = gokalkalkalol
dokalol = sakalal + mekalal
pekalol + pekalol - sakalal - mekalal = rekalol
lokalal - pekalol = sakalal
nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol
namekalal + namekalal = fanamekalol
fanamekalol * mekalal = pekalol
zokalal + pekalol = sakalkalal

In addition, it appears that someone was counting in this system. They erased most of their writing; however, the following numbers were not erased, and are found in the following order with no lines in between them:

lokalal
nagokalol
fanagokalal
gokalol
nazokalal
fanazokalol
zokalal


Note: I worked on this with NETWORKSecurity!

I don't actually know how to do a write-up for this problem, so I'll just go through the steps I went through with network security to solve this.

First I saw that 
namekalal + namekalal = fanamekalol
so 2namekalal = fanamekalol .

and then: namekalal + fanamekalol = mekalal 
 3namekalal = mekalal
I went ahead and replaced all remaining equations in terms of namekalal then, since the question asked for namekalal + another number.
I also went ahead and simplified a couple of the equations, i.e. combining 2 pekalols into "2pekalol"

nadokalol * 3namekalal = nadokalkalol
pekalol + 3namekalal = sakalal
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
namekalal * dokalol = fanamekalol * pekalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal
2pekalol + 3namekalal - lokalal = rekalol
sakalkalal * pekalol = gokalkalkalol
dokalol = sakalal + 3namekalal
2pekalol - sakalal - 3namekalal = rekalol
lokalal - pekalol = sakalal
nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol
2namekalal * 3namekalal = pekalol 
zokalal + pekalol = sakalkalal

2namekalal * 3namekalal = pekalol 
6 (namekalal^2) = pekalol.

I will substitute
sakalal = pekalol + 3namekalal
into
2pekalol - sakalal - 3namekalal = rekalol
which gives:
2pekalol - pekalol - 3namekalal - 3namekalal = rekalol
pekalol - 6namkelal = rekalol

From the equation
lokalal - pekalol = sakalal
you get, lokalal = sakalal + pekalol
substitute this value for lokalal into:
2pekalol + 3namekalal - lokalal = rekalol
gives 
2pekalol + 3namekalal - pekalol - sakalal = rekalol
Substitute sakalal, you get:
pekalol + 3 namekalal - pekalol - 3namekalal = rekalol
0 = rekalol
Substitute this into previously obtained equation
pekalol - 6namkelal = rekalol = 0
therefore pekalol = 6namekalal
but!
6 (namekalal^2) = pekalol
therefore namekalal = 1, and pekalol = 6!!!

from this the following values can be easily derived from the above equations.

rekalol					0
namekalal				1
fanamekalol				2
mekalal					3
pekalol					6
sakalal					9
dokalol					12
lokalal					15
gokalol					18      *NOTE, the derivation of gokalol will be explained below
zokalal					21			

The first thing I noticed is that lal means odd, and lol means even!

You then have 2 very similar equations:
nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal
a number times mekalal means you add an extra kal to the number, therefore an extra kal means "that number, times 3"

sakalkalal * pekalol = gokalkalkalol
then means
3sakalal * pekalol = 9gokalol
3*9 * 6 = 9 * gokalol
18 = gokalol

This same understanding of kal will explain why zokalal is 21.

At this point I found it merit-worthy to look at the lines:

In addition, it appears that someone was counting in this system. They erased most of their writing; however, the following numbers were not erased, and are found in the following order with no lines in between them:

lokalal					(We know is 15)
nagokalol
fanagokalal
gokalol					(We know is 18)
nazokalal
fanazokalol
zokalal					(We know is 21)

This seems to imply the numbers are in an arithmetic series, and if we fill in the blanks a bit we get

lokalal					(We know is 15)
nagokalol				16
fanagokalal				17
gokalol					(We know is 18)
nazokalal				19
fanazokalol				20
zokalal					(We know is 21)

This implies that na means "Whatever comes after it minus 2", and fana means "Whatever comes after it, minus 1"
this works for fanamekalol and namekalal, as they can be interpreted as mekalal -1, and -2 respectively.

BUT! From our equations in which we determined what an extra kal meant,
nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal

nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
which means the the na subtracts from the dokalol, before it is multiplied by 3. This is important to note.


From all this we can figure out that our answer(namekalal+zokalal) is equal to (1+21) = 22!
Now we just need to figure out how to write 22 in this language!


Equations left:
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol

Lets start with the first one, b/c it looks smaller
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
12*3 - 1 = 35
so:
fanavodokalkalal = 35
*Note, to be perfectly honest, I have solved this problem, and I have absolutely no idea what the vo means.
We know that dokalkalal = 36, and vo does some sort of prefix like thing(Possibly just be a placeholder?),
so the nafa only subtracts from the 36. (I.e. It does not subtract from dokalal before multiplying by 3 for the extra kal)
So by adding an extra prefix, the first prefix does whatever to the dokalol before multiplying by 3, and then the fana comes into effect after multiplication.

nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol
10 * 13 = 130
Soo
nafanavolokalkalkalol = 130
This is far more confusing to look at than the last equation.
lokalkalkalol = 135
We said that a prefix can take precedence over multiplying by 3 for the kal's earlier, so leftmost prefix effects the number at the end, and the rightmost prefix affects the number
before it gets multiplied. I still do not know exactly how to multiply these numbers into 130, but that is fairly irrelevant with the revelation from the last number.
It is the ideas here that matter.

We need to obtain 22 from only these numbers:


0
1
2
3
6
9
12
15
18
21

and these operations: -1,-2, *3.

22 = 24-2
24=8*3
8 = fanasakalol
24 = fanasakalkalol
22 then equals nafanasakalkalol!!!

This was a tough, but fun problem!
Note could someone please check that this is easy to follow/good format for a write-up?
