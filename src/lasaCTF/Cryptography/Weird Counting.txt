*Note I have added on my own the numbers that each line corresponds to.
I thought this was a pretty neat problem. I will attempt in this explanation to relate the 
steps that I went through to solve this problem.

The first thing I noticed was that even numbers ended with a, and odd numbers ended with o.
I then noticed that all powers of 2 were only 2 letter "words/numbers", i.e. zo = 2^0 = 1, fa = 2^1 = 2, la = 2^2 = 4 and etc.

The next thing I noticed was that each prime number is fa plus (n-1) zo's, where n is which prime it is. (i.e. 2 = 1st prime, 3 = 2nd prime, 5 = 3rd prime and so on)
The next thing I noticed was that if you divide a number by 2, the fa at the end becomes a zo. This meant that the final digit was its multiple of 2!!!
So the final digit meant how many multiple of 2 it had! zo means its multiplied by 2 0 times, (2^0), fa means that it is multiplied by 2 1 time, (2^1), and la means multiplied by 2 2 times.
La can be seen in fala which equals fazo(3) * la (4). 9 then, it is fazo (3) Squared and is written as lazo. This implies that the leftmost digit is 3 instead of 2, it is the second prime.
so fazo means 3^1 * 2^0. From this we have that the numbers in this writing system give you the prime factorization (RSA Probably wouldn't work too well here in this number system),
and the digit tells you what power that number is raised to!

So to answer the question: What is nalazofa in base 10?
this is equal then to nazozozo * lazozo * zozo * fa 
                    = (4th prime)^4 * (3rd prime)^2 * first prime
                    = 7^4 * 5^2 * 2^1 = 120050 !! (This is the right answer)
                    
I hope this write-up is in the style desired, I have no experience in writing these, please give me any comments and tell me if this was pewp.
