This was a rather cool problem!
Problem Info:
{
  "name": "Postman",
  "category": "Web Exploitation",
  "description": "Kyle made an super secure website only accesible by the Google Ultron browser. Figure out how to login to <a href=\"http://{{server}}:{{port}}\"> his site.</a>",
  "score" : 50,
  "hints": ["<a href='https://www.getpostman.com/'>Postman</a> is pretty cool"],

So when you go to the website you get:
Error: Unauthorized browser <Info about your browser here> detected. Only users of "Google Ultron" may access this page."
To remedy this, you had to edit your "user-agent" http-header. For more info about headers read the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields
I have included my code to solve the problem as an additional java file. The user-agent header tells the website which browser you are using.

Once you change your user-agent string to Google Ultron, you get:
Error: "SpecialAuth" header not set to my name
To remedy this, you must read around their about page where they say "All references to anyone known as Kyle is accidental" or something to that effect.
I recalled reading Kyle, so I attempted to add a request property "SpecialAuth" And set that to Kyle, and it worked.
So once the special auth header had been set to Kyle, you then get:

Error: This site must be accessed from "kyleisacoolguy.org"
The http header that tells the server your last website is known as the "referer" so you must set the referer header to that website.
Once all that is done, you get the answer:
Successfully Authenticated! Your flag is:lasactf{h3aders_ar3_c00l}

Attached as a seperate file is my java code to complete this challenge.
